The goal of this code, which was 100% generated by ChatGPT as a basic framework, is to provide a guide on what specific skills are available to you during the separate phases of your turn in Age of Sigmar. Different skills need to be loaded, and I have no idea what the UI looks like, but the intent would be to be able to choose the player turn (yours or opponent) and then which phase you are in within that turn. In doing so, separate skills + descriptions will show up on screen. That's it.
